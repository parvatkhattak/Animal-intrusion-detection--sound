# Elephant Sound Classification Model

This repository contains a deep learning model and accompanying code to classify sounds as *Elephant* or *Not Elephant*. This project is a part of the **Animal Intrusion Detection and Deterrence** system designed to protect crops and minimize conflicts between humans and wildlife.

## Overview

The classification system focuses on detecting elephant sounds in audio data. The goal is to help identify potential elephant intrusions in real time and trigger appropriate deterrent mechanisms.


## How It Works

1. **Notebook Execution**: Use `main.ipynb` to load the model and classify sounds based on input audio files.
2. **Binary Classification**: The system determines whether an input sound is an elephant sound or not.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parvatkhattak/elephant-sound-detection.git
   cd elephant-sound-detection

2. Install dependencies
 
3. Run the project
```bash
python main.py
```
